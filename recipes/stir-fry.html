        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cave carrot, <em>matchstick or julienned</em></li>
            <li>common mushroom, <em>sliced</em></li>
            <li>kale, <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
            <li>oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><em>Optional Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ginger, <em>grated</em></li>
            <li>garlic, <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
            <li>soy sauce, <em>cornstarch and sesame oil</em></li>
            <li>cooked rice, <em>for serving</em></li>
            <li>sesame seeds and sliced green onions, <em>for garnish</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add your vegetable oil to the bottom of a wok or non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Once your oil starts shimmering, add your garlic, ginger, and mushrooms.</li>
            <li>When the mushrooms are mostly cooked through (roughly 3 minutes), add in your kale. Continue stirring and cooking until the kale goes bright green and wilts slightly, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the carrot matchsticks and cook for about 1 minute, to get rid of the rawness but maintain the crunch. </li>
            <li><em>Optional:</em> Combine soy sauce with cornstarch and sesame oil. Pour the mixture over your cooked vegetables and stir, cooking for another minute or two until sauce is thickened and coats everything.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately over cooked rice. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions.</li>
        </ol>
