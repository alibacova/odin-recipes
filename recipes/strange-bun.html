        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Strange Bun is a fluffy perfection with delicious bright pinkish purple filling. My dear friend Shane recently shared this recipe with me.</p>
        <p>It's my favorite snack when I'm running errands in Stardew Valley, even though not many appreciate it as much as I do. Nothing beats 100 Energy and 45 Health in such a pretty form!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>wheat flour</li>
            <li>periwinkle</li>
            <li>void mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
            <li>Generously oil or spray a 12-cup muffin tin and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Gently crack the periwinkle shell and set it aside. You can grind the periwinkle shell and use it as a fertilizer or dye.</li>

            <li>Stir in the wheat flour. Spoon the mixture into the prepared muffin tin.</li>
